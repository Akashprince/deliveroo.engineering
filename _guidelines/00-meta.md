#### Why we do this

In a large team, building and maintaining multiple software assets, code
consistency and acquired good practices matter.

Having solid guidelines is a pillar of maintainable software, much like
continuous integration and a solid review process.


#### Using guidelines

We recommend that all new starters read the guidelines documents relevant to the
technologies they'll be using.

When reviewing any code, the guidelines apply: it is seriously frowned upon not
to follow them!

Of course, guidelines aren't law â€” one may ignore them, but there must be a
justification, and preferably a comment in the code.
"My team doesn't have time", or other forms of the [threshold of
misery](http://kerrizor.com/blog/2016/05/09/returning-from-the-threshold-of-misery),
usually aren't valid reasons to skirt the guidelines :smiling_imp:

Note that the code in a pull request should follow the guidelines, _even_ if the
author of the PR isn't the author of the original code. This is how old code
gets updated over time.

#### Changing guidelines

Coding guidelines are curated collectively.
This is the process we choose to follow:

1. Anyone can submit a pull request to change, or add to any guideline document
   (including this one). Each document has an "edit" link at the top to help, so
   editing is possible within Github.

2. Changes are reviewed by lead engineers. Anyone can comment on the content.

3. During a 1 week grace period, :thumbsup: and :thumbsdown: are collected on
   the pull request (+1 comments are ignored).

4. If the change has collected enough :thumbsup:, a lead engineer merges it.
   <br/>
   This site is automatically updated.

From this point onwards, all engineers in the team should follow the updated
guidelines for _new_ code, and strive to bring _old_ code in compliance - over
time, as mentioned above. It is not recommended to upgrade old code in bulk, as
this can be much more difficult to test/QA properly.

#### Notifying about changes

When a pull request is issued, the `#geeks` and `#tech-leads` channels in Slack
are pinged automatically (through Zapier).

Nothing is (currently) done automatically when a pull request is merged, though,
so you may want to broadcast in `#geeks` or via email as appropriate.


#### Formatting guidelines

This site uses Jekyll and Github Pages, so Markdown is favoured.

Use of emoji is encouraged!

You may respect an 80 column limit in the source to facilitate reviews, or not
if you're content with Github wrapping lines for you.
