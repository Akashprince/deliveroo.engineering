Hi I’m Reemma, a second year at UCL studying Computer Science. I’m a huge fan of food, but unfortunately I can’t ride a bike (yet). I like front-end web and app dev but I’m open to trying out new things! When I’m not too busy being a student, I love getting involved with the tech community to organise tech conferences, hackathons and coding workshops.

Fun fact: I have various degrees of fluency in 5 languages (non-programming kind).
