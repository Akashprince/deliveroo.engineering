I've been _androiding_ since 2010 in large companies and small startups. I moved to London in 2011 from Romania and joined Deliveroo in November 2015 to work in the Android team, which I've helped release our [Consumer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deliveroo.orderapp&hl=en_GB).
