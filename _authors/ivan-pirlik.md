When I was about 10, I accidentally wiped the bootloader from my parents' computer before
an important presentation. A day later, I had managed to rebuild it and had the computer
running again. That started a lifelong journey to find out how I did it: I still haven't
figured it out, but I did learn a lot of other interesting things in the process.

Was found on the streets with a "will code for food" sign, and Deliveroo took me literally!
