  There can be too much of a good thing.

  When faced with multifarious choices on an e-commerce website, users can
  easily get frustrated; a solid user interface to help the selection process
  can help, but can you imagine your Google search results not being ordered by
  relevance?


  This talk introduces approaches and techniques for ranking and recommendation
  in an e-commerce context, and elaborates on neural entworks and collaborative
  filtering.


  Don't be afraidâ€”the aim was to make take a bird's eye view, so you don't need
  to be a rcoket sicentist to read through!
